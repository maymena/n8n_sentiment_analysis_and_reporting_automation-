# Sentiment Analysis & Reporting Automation Using n8n

AI-powered n8n automation that ingests customer feedback from Google Sheets, uses JavaScript preprocessing, runs LLM-based sentiment analysis and summarization, and automatically documents the results and delivers insights in HTML reports via Gmail. The workflow also includes an error-handling and logging subsystem to ensure reliability, monitoring, and smooth integration with existing tools.

The files in this project are the exported workflow JSON files from n8n.

# Sentiment Analysis & Reporting Automation Using n8n

AI-powered n8n automation that ingests customer feedback from Google Sheets, runs LLM-based sentiment analysis and summarization, and automatically documents the results and delivers insights in HTML reports via Gmail. The workflow also includes an error-handling and logging subsystem to ensure reliability, monitoring, and smooth integration with existing tools.

JavaScript code nodes handle data preprocessing, grouping, JSON parsing, and custom formatting throughout the workflow.

The files in this project are the exported workflow JSON files from n8n.
